# Methods
Here we define the concept of substitution as all change in carbon balance resulting from an increase in wood use. With this definition in mind, literature on forest science, life cycle analysis (LCA), energy and construction engineering and applied economics was systematically and critically reviewed in the form of a meta-analysis to assess: (1) available methodologies and current practices for quantifying substitution as well as (2) the effect of biological, physical and socio-economical drivers and system’s boundaries on substitution estimates.
Carbon potential is quantified using two indices of carbon sequestration based on the sequestered carbon in the reference $C_{reference}$ and alternative $C_{alternative}$ scenarios respectively, and for substitution on the amount of wood used $Q_{reference}$ and $Q_{alternative}$.

$$ C_{ratio} = {C_{alternative} - C_{reference}  \over |C_{reference}|} $$
$$ Substitution = { C_{alternative} - C_{reference} \over Q_{alternative} - Q_{reference}} $$
