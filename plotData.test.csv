The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites. However, a comprehensive substitution analysis of wood-based energy, in respect to environmental benefits, would also require the inclusion of CO2 emissions related to ecosystem processes (e.g. decomposition).","Eur.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed. Therefore, wood product utilization would only be favorable from a climate perspective in DL_FP or RIL pathways. These results help screen different land conversion policy options and providing information about the climate mitigation potential of wood products in different supply chains. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In Indonesia, however, many wood-based products originate from unsustainable sources due to widespread land-use changes over the past decades. To reconcile economic development and climate policy, a detailed and comprehensive carbon life cycle assessment is needed, covering biospheric and technospheric woody carbon flows and emissions over time. In this study, we combine dynamic material flow analysis, stock modeling, and life cycle assessment to estimate life cycle carbon emissions over time of wood products from different land conversion types in Indonesia on a hectare (ha) basis. Wood production from clear-cut primary forest conversions to oil palm, secondary forest, and timber plantations lead to net carbon emissions between 1206-1282, 436-449, and 629-958 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, at the end of the 200-year time horizon (TH). The counter-use scenarios of using non-renewable materials or energy instead of wood-based products for the same set of scenarios while leaving primary forests untouched display 44-57, 59-88, and 5-48% lower global warming potentials, respectively, at the end of the TH. Wood products from forest plantations on restored degraded land (DL_FP), reduced-impact logging (RIL), and improved reduced-impact logging (RIL-C) of primary forest went beyond carbon neutrality, displaying carbon removal potentials of up to around -218, -378, and -739 t-CO2-eq/ha, respectively, by year 200. At the one ha-scale, our results indicate that keeping primary forests intact is the climate-preferable option, even when emissions from the counter-use of non-renewable materials or energy are factored in, except if RIL is performed.

This study aims at assessing the potential of cascading use of woody biomass for reducing GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and increasing the overall wood flow efficiency in the European Union's forest and bioeconomy sectors. A scenario and life cycle approach was followed to quantify the potential benefits of cascading use of woody biomass. We started from a reference scenario in which (post-consumer) waste wood and paper are re-utilized for energy only (S0). Then we compared the reference scenario with two alternative scenarios, the current waste wood and paper recycling practices (S1) and the maximum technical potential to increase recycling of waste wood and paper flows (S2). Following a supply chain perspective, different stages of production were analysed, including forgone fossil-fuels substitution, optimization at manufacturing level and forest regrowth. Through cascading use, the wood use efficiency ratio (cascade factor) in the European wood sector would be increased by 23% (S0 vs S1) and 31% (S0 vs S2) and GHG emissions (cradle-to-gate energy use) would be reduced by 42% (28 MtCO(2)-eq/year) and 52% (35 MtCO(2)-eq/year) in scenarios S1 and S2. However, increased wood product cascading is counter effected in the short term by reduced savings in the energy sector by 49% and 48% (-43 and -42 MtCO(2)-eq/year) in scenarios S1 and S2 due to delayed availability of waste wood and waste paper fibers. This explorative study highlights the potential of cascading use of woody biomass in the wood production chains to contribute to a reduction of environmental impacts related to wood resource and energy use, but it also reveals trade-offs in terms of GHG emissions reduction, relevant especially in meeting short-term (2020-2030) renewable energy targets.

This study aims at assessing the potential of cascading use of woody biomass for reducing GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and increasing the overall wood flow efficiency in the European Union's forest and bioeconomy sectors. A scenario and life cycle approach was followed to quantify the potential benefits of cascading use of woody biomass. We started from a reference scenario in which (post-consumer) waste wood and paper are re-utilized for energy only (S0). Then we compared the reference scenario with two alternative scenarios, the current waste wood and paper recycling practices (S1) and the maximum technical potential to increase recycling of waste wood and paper flows (S2). Following a supply chain perspective, different stages of production were analysed, including forgone fossil-fuels substitution, optimization at manufacturing level and forest regrowth. Through cascading use, the wood use efficiency ratio (cascade factor) in the European wood sector would be increased by 23% (S0 vs S1) and 31% (S0 vs S2) and GHG emissions (cradle-to-gate energy use) would be reduced by 42% (28 MtCO(2)-eq/year) and 52% (35 MtCO(2)-eq/year) in scenarios S1 and S2. However, increased wood product cascading is counter effected in the short term by reduced savings in the energy sector by 49% and 48% (-43 and -42 MtCO(2)-eq/year) in scenarios S1 and S2 due to delayed availability of waste wood and waste paper fibers. This explorative study highlights the potential of cascading use of woody biomass in the wood production chains to contribute to a reduction of environmental impacts related to wood resource and energy use, but it also reveals trade-offs in terms of GHG emissions reduction, relevant especially in meeting short-term (2020-2030) renewable energy targets.

The primary energy input (mainly fossil fuels) in the production of building materials was found to be about 60-80% higher when concrete frames were considered instead of wood frames. The net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for wood materials will depend strongly on how the wood is handled after demolition of the building. The net GHG balance will be slightly positive if all the demolition wood is used to replace fossil fuels, slightly negative if part of the demolition wood is re-used, and clearly positive if all wood is deposited in landfills, due to the production of CH4. However, if the biogas produced is collected and used to replace fossil fuels, the net GHG emissions will be insignificant. If concrete frames are used, the net GHG emissions will be about those when demolition wood from the wood-framed building is deposited in landfills and no biogas is collected. We have considered that the CO2 released from the chemical processes in the production of cement will be re-bound to the concrete by the carbonisation process. Otherwise, the net GHG emission would be more than twice as high when concrete frames are used. If forest biomass is used instead of fossil fuels, the net area of forest land required to supply both raw material and energy for the production of building materials, will be about twice as high when wood frames are used instead of concrete frames. However, the GHG mitigation efficiency, expressed as CO, equivalents per unit area of forest land, will be 2-3 times higher when wood frames are used if excess wood waste and logging residues are used to replace fossil fuels. The excess forest in the: concrete frame alternative is used to replace fossil fuels, but if this forest is used for carbon storage, the mitigation efficiency will be higher for the first forest rotation period (100 yr), but lower for the following rotation periods. Some of the data used in the analyses are uncertain, but an understanding of the complexity in comparing different alternatives for utilising forest for GHG mitigation, and of the fact that the time perspective applied affects the results markedly, is more important for the results than the precise figures in the input data.

The primary energy input (mainly fossil fuels) in the production of building materials was found to be about 60-80% higher when concrete frames were considered instead of wood frames. The net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for wood materials will depend strongly on how the wood is handled after demolition of the building. The net GHG balance will be slightly positive if all the demolition wood is used to replace fossil fuels, slightly negative if part of the demolition wood is re-used, and clearly positive if all wood is deposited in landfills, due to the production of CH4. However, if the biogas produced is collected and used to replace fossil fuels, the net GHG emissions will be insignificant. If concrete frames are used, the net GHG emissions will be about those when demolition wood from the wood-framed building is deposited in landfills and no biogas is collected. We have considered that the CO2 released from the chemical processes in the production of cement will be re-bound to the concrete by the carbonisation process. Otherwise, the net GHG emission would be more than twice as high when concrete frames are used. If forest biomass is used instead of fossil fuels, the net area of forest land required to supply both raw material and energy for the production of building materials, will be about twice as high when wood frames are used instead of concrete frames. However, the GHG mitigation efficiency, expressed as CO, equivalents per unit area of forest land, will be 2-3 times higher when wood frames are used if excess wood waste and logging residues are used to replace fossil fuels. The excess forest in the: concrete frame alternative is used to replace fossil fuels, but if this forest is used for carbon storage, the mitigation efficiency will be higher for the first forest rotation period (100 yr), but lower for the following rotation periods. Some of the data used in the analyses are uncertain, but an understanding of the complexity in comparing different alternatives for utilising forest for GHG mitigation, and of the fact that the time perspective applied affects the results markedly, is more important for the results than the precise figures in the input data.

When looking at forest carbon cycles there is potential in utilizing another feedback cycle, namely the carbon cycle involving harvested wood products. To assess the potential of the mitigation options arising from these carbon flows, the forest-based sector in Austria was modelled to assess causal links, dependencies and dynamics involved in GHG-relevant processes. Carbon dynamics were investigated in forests and forest soil carbon, the forest product chain and life-cycle analyses for substitution of conventional products with wood products in a cascade of different modelling approaches and paradigms, and the results synthesized. It was found that material use of products from domestic timber sources has the highest climate change mitigation efficiency when originating from sustainably managed forests regarding biomass stocks. The emissions saved through building up a carbon stock from harvested wood products and through emissions substitution can be as high as similar to 20 years of total annual Austrian emissions in 90 years. Additional conservation measures while sustaining sawnwood production and the related GHG benefits at a high level had the highest contribution to an overall carbon sink.","Carbon Manag.","Article",2016,27,"10.1080/17583004.2016.1230990",NA,"Braun_2016","included","AV",NA,"v5","SL","managed area","scenario 2","R",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,"area subject to harvest","Mobilize additional wood","HWP","m3 utilized wood","fig5","Gm3",1.16745219134297,1.80514078498292,"1.5462224477958166",0.637688593639949,637688593.639949,"Sequestration positive","fig8","GtCO2-eq","1.93686006825938","1.4146757679180799",0.730396475770923,-0.5221843003413,NA,-522184300.3413,-0.818870378973934,"0","0",0,"0",0,0,0,0,0,"0",0,"0",0,0,"refOK",1.16745219134297,1.80514078498292,637688593.639949,1.93686006825938,1.41467576791808,-522184300.3413,-0.818870378973934,-0.269603524229077,"coy","reg","Austria",2010,2100,90,"71-100",0,1,1,1,NA,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber",1,0,"0","0","0",1,"self-calculated DF",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,"m3 utilized wood calculated from CCME.

We evaluated forest sector carbon trends and potential mitigation scenarios in Vermont using a systems-based modeling framework that accounts for net emissions from all forest sector components. These components comprise (1) the forest ecosystem, including land-use change, (2) harvested wood products (HWP), and (3) substitution effects associated with using renewable wood-based products and fuels in place of more emission-intensive materials and fossil fuel-based energy. We assessed baseline carbon trends from 1995 through 2050 using a business as usual (BAU) scenario. Emission reductions associated with different forest management and HWP scenarios were evaluated relative to the BAU scenario from 2020 to 2050. We estimated uncertainty for each forest sector component and used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the distribution of cumulative total mitigation for each scenario relative to baseline. Our analysis indicates that the strength of the forest sector carbon sink in Vermont has been declining and will continue to decline over coming decades under the BAU scenario. However, several scenarios evaluated here could be effective in reducing emissions and enhancing carbon uptake. Shifting HWP to longer-lived commodities resulted in a 14% reduction in net cumulative emissions by 2050, the largest reduction of all scenarios. A scenario that combined extending harvest rotations, utilizing additional harvest residues for bioenergy, and increasing forest productivity resulted in a 12% reduction in net cumulative emissions. Shifting commodities from pulp and paper to bioenergy showed a 7.3% reduction in emissions. In contrast, shortening rotations to increase harvests for bioenergy use resulted in a 5.5% increase in emissions. In summary, model simulations suggest that net emissions could be reduced by up to 14% relative to BAU, depending on the management and HWP-use scenario. Combining multiple scenarios could further enhance reductions. However, realizing the full climate mitigation potential of these forests may be challenging due to socioeconomic barriers to implementation, as well as alternative management objectives that must be considered along with carbon sequestration.","Ecol.

Emission reductions associated with different forest management and HWP scenarios were evaluated relative to the BAU scenario from 2020 to 2050. We estimated uncertainty for each forest sector component and used a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the distribution of cumulative total mitigation for each scenario relative to baseline. Our analysis indicates that the strength of the forest sector carbon sink in Vermont has been declining and will continue to decline over coming decades under the BAU scenario. However, several scenarios evaluated here could be effective in reducing emissions and enhancing carbon uptake. Shifting HWP to longer-lived commodities resulted in a 14% reduction in net cumulative emissions by 2050, the largest reduction of all scenarios. A scenario that combined extending harvest rotations, utilizing additional harvest residues for bioenergy, and increasing forest productivity resulted in a 12% reduction in net cumulative emissions. Shifting commodities from pulp and paper to bioenergy showed a 7.3% reduction in emissions. In contrast, shortening rotations to increase harvests for bioenergy use resulted in a 5.5% increase in emissions. In summary, model simulations suggest that net emissions could be reduced by up to 14% relative to BAU, depending on the management and HWP-use scenario. Combining multiple scenarios could further enhance reductions. However, realizing the full climate mitigation potential of these forests may be challenging due to socioeconomic barriers to implementation, as well as alternative management objectives that must be considered along with carbon sequestration.","Ecol.

Conventional tree production for energy increases net CO(2) emissions relative to preserving forests, but fast-growing tree production may reduce net CO(2) emissions more than preserving forests does. When wood from fast-growing trees is used to generate electricity with gas turbines, displacing natural gas, the net CO(2) emission reduction from the combination of fast-growing trees and electricity generation with gas turbines is about 58% of the CO(2) emission reduction from electricity generation from gas turbines alone in 2050, and an energy conversion efficiency of around 20% or more is required to obtain net reductions over the entire period until 2050. When wood is used to produce bioethanol, displacing gasoline, net reductions are realized after 2030, provided that heat energy is recovered from residues from ethanol production.

The components of the net carbon exchange include the uptake of carbon into biomass, the decomposition of litter and humus, emissions from forest management operations and carbon released from the combustion of biomass and degradation of wood-based products. The tool enables the allocation of the total carbon emissions to the timber and energy biomass and to the energy produced on the basis of biomass. In example computations, ecosystem model simulations were utilized as an input to the tool. We present results for traditional timber production (pulpwood and saw logs) and integrated timber and bioenergy production (logging residues, stumps and roots) for Norway spruce, in boreal conditions in Finland, with two climate scenarios over one rotation period. The results showed that the magnitude of management related emissions on net carbon exchange was smaller when compared with the total ecosystem fluxes; decomposition being the largest emission contributor. In addition, the effects of management and climate were higher on the decomposition of new humus compared with old humus. The results also showed that probable increased biomass growth, obtained under the changing climate (CC), could not compensate for decomposition and biomass combustion related carbon loss in southern Finland.

However, previous LCAs of CLT are static analyses without considering the complex interactions between the CLT manufacturing and forest systems, which are dynamic and largely affected by the variations in forest management, CLT manufacturing, and end-of-life options. This study fills this gap by developing a dynamic life-cycle modeling framework for a cradle-to-grave CLT manufacturing system across 100 years in the Southeastern United States. The framework integrates process-based simulations of CLT manufacturing and forest growth as well as Monte Carlo simulation to address uncertainty. On a 1-ha forest land basis, the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions range from -954 to -1445 metric tonne CO2 eq. for a high forest productivity scenario compared to -609 to -919 metric tonne CO2 eq. for a low forest productivity scenario. All scenarios showed significant GHG emissions from forest residues decay, demonstrating the strong needs to consider forest management and their dynamic impacts in LCAs of CLT or other durable wood products (DWP). The results show that using mill residues for energy recovery has lower fossil-based GHG (59%-61% reduction) than selling residues for producing DWP, but increases the net GHG emissions due to the instantaneous release of biogenic carbon in residues. In addition, the results were converted to a 1 m(3) basis with a cradle-to-gate system boundary to be compared with literature.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years.

This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

In simulations, we employed the ecosystem model and life cycle analyses tool with varying management scenarios (thinning, nitrogen fertilization and rotation length) on medium fertile and fertile sites in central Finland. We found that the annual mean timber production could be increased by using longer rotation lengths of 60-80 years. This was opposite to energy biomass production, which was increased the most by using shorter rotations of 30-50 years. On the other hand, both of them could be increased by applying nitrogen fertilization and by maintaining higher stocking over the rotation compared to the current Finnish baseline management. This positively affected both the carbon storage and carbon balance in forestry, as well as the energy carbon balance which takes into account both carbon balance for forestry and the CO2 emissions from the burning of energy biomass. It also decreased the CO2 emissions per unit of energy by approx. 30% compared to baseline management, regardless of site fertility type. Similarly, the carbon neutrality of the bioenergy system could be increased in this way compared to the use of coal instead. To conclude, based on proper management it will be possible to increase simultaneously the production of timber and energy biomass, and carbon stock in the forest ecosystem and to improve the forest ecosystem carbon balance so that in the long-term the CO2 uptake will exceed concurrent emissions.

The overall harvest from the region is restricted to the present level, in order to see which carbon benefits can be achieved while keeping a steady supply of timber to the forest industry. Under this restriction, maximising carbon benefit decreases the net present value of timber revenue from the region by 21%. There is more planting and less thinning compared to when timber revenue is maximised. If substitution effects, i.e. saved greenhouse gas emissions from use of wood products, are included in the analysis, it is optimal with more planting and thinning, although the changes are small in this case study because harvest level is held constant.

Changing forest management is a cost effective mitigation option.

On the other hand, net present value of carbon benefit (in ton CO2-equivalent) is increased by 1.4-1.6 times when substitution effects are included. Changing forest management is a cost effective mitigation option. For a cost of (sic) 0-10 per ton discounted CO2-equivalent, the net present value of carbon benefit from the area can be increased with 0.2-0.3 million tonnes CO2-equivalents on average in every year of the 120 years long planning horizon taking discounting into account (annuity).

In doing so, it measures the variability in inventory databases, transportation distance, lifetime of building components, biogenic carbon emissions, carbonation of concrete materials and end-of-life scenarios. Through the use of Monte Carlo analysis, the research found that the embodied carbon of a mass timber building ranged from 196 kgCO(2-e)/m(2) to 590 kgCO(2-e)/m(2) with a mean of 417 kgCO(2-e)/m(2). For a post-tensioned concrete building the range was 307 kgCO(2-e)/m(2) to 618 kgCO(2-e)/m(2) with a mean of 465 kgCO(2-e)/m(2). This equates to a 48 kgCO(2-e)/m(2) reduction in mean embodied carbon for the mass timber building. Using deterministic analysis, previous research suggested a more substantive 129 kgCO(2-e)/m(2) reduction. These results demonstrate that mass timber buildings do typically have a lower embodied carbon, compared to concrete buildings, however the significance of this depends on the assumptions made, and the input data used. For the concrete building, the variation in embodied carbon is primarily influenced by the inventory data and building products' lifetime. The greater range of embodied carbon in the mass timber building is due to variations associated with the inventory data, allocation of biogenic carbon emissions (sequestration, and forest management losses) and, different end-of-life scenarios associated with timber products. Despite this, the research suggests that with a carefully planned end-of-life strategy, mass timber mid-rise buildings have the potential to benefit from lower embodied carbon emissions, as compared to concrete buildings, across their full lifecycle.","Build.

Forests and their carbon (C) sequestration potential are affected by management practices, where wood harvesting transfers C out of the forest into products, and subsequent regrowth allows further C sequestration. Here we determine the mitigation potential of the 2.3 x 10(6) km(2) of Canada's managed forests from 2015 to 2050 using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3), a harvested wood products (HWP) model that estimates emissions based on product half-life decay times, and an account of emission substitution benefits from the use of wood products and bioenergy. We examine several mitigation scenarios with different assumptions about forest management activity levels relative to a base case scenario, including improved growth from silvicultural activities, increased harvest and residue management for bioenergy, and reduced harvest for conservation. We combine forest management options with two mitigation scenarios for harvested wood product use involving an increase in either long-lived products or bioenergy uses. Results demonstrate large differences among alternative scenarios, and we identify potential mitigation scenarios with increasing benefits to the atmosphere for many decades into the future, as well as scenarios with no net benefit over many decades. The greatest mitigation impact was achieved through a mix of strategies that varied across the country and had cumulative mitigation of 254 Tg CO(2)e in 2030, and 1180 Tg CO(2)e in 2050. There was a trade-off between short-term and long-term goals, in that maximizing short-term emissions reduction could reduce the forest sector's ability to contribute to longer-term objectives. We conclude that (i) national-scale forest sector mitigation options need to be assessed rigorously from a systems perspective to avoid the development of policies that deliver no net benefits to the atmosphere, (ii) a mix of strategies implemented across the country achieves the greatest mitigation impact, and (iii) because of the time delays in achieving carbon benefits for many forest-based mitigation activities, future contributions of the forest sector to climate mitigation can be maximized if implemented soon.","Biogeosciences","Article",2014,96,"10.5194/bg-11-3515-2014",NA,"Smyth_2014","included","TH",NA,"v5","AV","Commercial thinning for bionergy feedstock","Baseline","Bioenergy PCT",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,0,0,0,"mixed drivers","Multiple strategies","Roundwood","Additional harvest","Table 1","Tg C yr-1",0,0.62,NA,0.62,2692140.68606166,"Sequestration positive","fig3d","TgCO2e","4.5657142857142858","0.99428571428571422",0.217772215269086,-3.57142857142857,NA,-3571428.57142857,-1.32661290322581,"0","1",1,"1",0,0,0,0,0,"0",0,"0",0,0,"refOK",0,0.62,2692140.68606166,4.56571428571429,0.994285714285714,-3571428.57142857,-1.32661290322581,-0.782227784730914,"coy","reg","Canada",2015,2050,35,"31-70",0,1,1,1,NA,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber",1,1,"; varies for type of wood product from 0.38 to .77 Mg C avoided per Mg C of wood and varied btw -.08 and .779 for energy (across Canada)","0","0",2,"self-calculated DF",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,"Fix C estimates, they are given as cumulated but wood amount is given as yearly so C estimate should be divided by time period",NA,"supply chain organization","cutting intensity",0.001,"Multiple driver","Multiple strategies"

We compare the use of harvest residues for local heat and electricity production relative to a base case scenario and estimate the climate change mitigation potential at the forest management unit level. Results demonstrate large differences between and within provinces and territories across Canada. We identify regions with increasing benefits to the atmosphere for many decades into the future and regions where no net benefit would occur over the 33-year study horizon. The cumulative mitigation potential for regions with positive mitigation was predicted to be 429 Tg CO(2)e in 2050, with 7.1 TgC yr (-1) of harvest residues producing bioenergy that met 3.1% of the heat demand and 2.9% of the electricity demand for 32.1 million people living within these regions. Our results show that regions with positive mitigation produced bioenergy, mainly from combined heat and power facilities, with emissions intensities that ranged from roughly 90 to 500 kg CO(2)e MWh(-1). Roughly 40% of the total captured harvest residue was associated with regions that were predicted to have a negative cumulative mitigation potential in 2050 of -152 Tg CO(2)e. We conclude that the capture of harvest residues to produce local bioenergy can reduce GHG emissions in populated regions where bioenergy, mainly from combined heat and power facilities, offsets fossil fuel sources (fuel oil, coal and petcoke, and natural gas).","GCB Bioenergy","Article",2017,28,"10.1111/gcbb.12387",NA,"Smyth_2017","included","TH",NA,"v5","AV","Use harvest residues for bioenergy; reduce slashburning","Baseline","Bioenergy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,2,1,0,0,"mixed drivers","Multiple strategies","Roundwood","Residue Use",NA,"Tg C yr-1",1,11.9,NA,10.9,47329570.1259227,"Sequestration positive",NA,"TgCO2e","-379.5","-112.2",0.295652173913043,267.3,NA,267300000,5.64763211009174,"0","1",1,"1",0,0,0,0,0,"0",0,"0",0,0,"refOK",1,11.9,47329570.1259227,-379.5,-112.2,267300000,5.64763211009174,0.704347826086957,"coy","reg","Canada",2017,2050,33,"31-70",0,1,1,1,NA,3,"mixedProduct","0","Energy","Pulp/Paper","Timber",1,1,"; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcbb.12389","0","0",2,"self-calculated DF",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,"Whole sector approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,"supply chain organization","harvesting system:efficiency improvement",0.001,"Multiple driver","Multiple strategies"

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia's forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070.

In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070. Conclusions The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","Carbon Balanc.

All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO(2)e year(-1)over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO(2)e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO(2)increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO(2)e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for theHigher Recoveryscenario in 2070. Conclusions The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations.","Carbon Balanc.

We study the trade-offs and synergies between these strategies using three different Finnish national-level forest scenarios between 2015 and 2044 as examples. We demonstrate how GHG emissions change when wood harvest rates are increased. We take into account CO2 and other greenhouse gas flows in the forest, the decay rate of harvested wood products and fossil-based CO2 emissions that can be avoided by substituting alternative materials with wood derived from increased harvests. We considered uncertainties of key parameters by using stochastic simulation. According to our results, an increase in harvest rates in Finland increased the total net GHG flow to the atmosphere virtually certainly or very likely, given the uncertainties and time frame considered. This was because the increased biomass-based CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere together with decreased carbon sequestration into the forest were very likely higher than the avoided fossil-based CO2 emissions. The reverse of this conclusion would require that compared to what was studied in this paper, the share of long-living wood products in the product mix would be higher, carbon dioxide from bioenergy production would be captured and stored, and reduction in forest carbon equivalent net sink due to wood harvesting would be minimized.","Mitig.

This study quantifies the carbon costs and benefits for the French forestry sector in meeting these targets. A forest growth and harvest simulator was developed for French forests using recent forest inventory data, and the wood-use chain was reconstructed from national wood product statistics. We then projected wood production, bioenergy production, and carbon balance for three realistic intensification scenarios and a business-as-usual scenario. These intensification scenarios targeted either overstocked, harvest-delayed or currently actively managed stands. Results: All three intensification strategies produced 11.6-12.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year of wood-based energy by 2026, which corresponds to the target assigned to French wood-energy to meet the EU 2020 renewable energy target. Sustaining this level past 2026 will be challenging, let alone further increasing it. Although energy production targets can be reached, the management intensification required will degrade the near-term carbon balance of the forestry sector, compared to continuing present-day management. Even for the best-performing intensification strategy, i.e., reducing the harvest diameter of actively managed stands, the carbon benefits would only become apparent after 2040. The carbon balance of a strategy putting abandoned forests back into production would only break even by 2055; the carbon balance from increasing thinning in managed but untended stands would not break even within the studied time periods, i.e. 2015-2045 and 2046-2100. Owing to the temporal dynamics in the components of the carbon balance, i.e., the biomass stock in the forest, the carbon stock in wood products, and substitution benefits, the merit order of the examined strategies varies over time.

Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.

The greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics related to the production, use and disposal of wood products are manifold and show a complex time pattern. On the one hand, wood products can be considered as a carbon pool, as is the forest itself. On the other hand, an increased use of wood can lead to the substitution of usually more energy-intense materials and to the substitution of fossil fuels when the thermal energy of wood is recovered. Country-specific import/export flows of wood products and their alternative products as well as their processing stage have to be considered if substitution effects are assessed on a national basis. We present an integral model-based approach to evaluate the GHG impacts of various forest management and wood use scenarios. Our approach allows us to analyse the complex temporal and spatial patterns of GHG emissions and removals including trade-offs of different forest management and wood use strategies. This study shows that the contributions of the forestry and timber sector to mitigate climate change can be optimized with the following key recommendations: (1) the maximum possible, sustainable increment should be generated in the forest, taking into account biodiversity conservation as well as the long-term preservation of soil quality and growth performance; (2) this increment should be harvested continuously; (3) the harvested wood should be processed in accordance with the principle of cascade use, i.e. first be used as a material as long as possible, preferably in structural components; (4) waste wood that is not suitable for further use should be used to generate energy. Political strategies to solely increase the use of wood as a biofuel cannot be considered efficient from a climate perspective; (5) forest management strategies to enhance carbon sinks in forests via reduced harvesting are not only ineffective because of a compensatory increase in fossil fuel consumption for the production of non-wooden products and thermal energy but also because of the Kyoto-cap that limits the accountability of GHG removals by sinks under Article 3.3 and 3.4, at least for the first commitment period; (6) the effect of substitution through the material and energy use of wood is more significant and sustained as compared with the stock effects in wood products, which tend towards new steady-state flow equilibria with no further increase of C stocks; (7) from a global perspective, the effect of material substitution exceeds that of energy recovery from wood. In the Swiss context, however, the energy recovery from wood generates a greater substitution effect than material substitution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Environ. Sci.
